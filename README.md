## Project 1: [COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python](https://yifanlintw.github.io/Data-Project/)
In this project we are going to use COVID19 dataset we have consisting of data-related cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, and deaths cases. we are going to prepare this dataset to answer these questions: How does Global Spread of the virus look like? How intensive the spread of the virus has been in the countries? Does covid19 national lockdowns and self-isolations in different countries have actually impact on COVID19 transmission? we are going to use Plotly module, which is a great visualization tool in python, in order to plot some insightful and intuitive graphs to answer the questions.
